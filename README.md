# Dotfiles

A set of configuration for a modern, minimalistic shell environment.

## Installation

To use, clone the repository and run the install script. This symlinks in the configuration. No files will be overwritten, you will need to delete any eventual pre-existing local files to fully use this collection.

```
git clone https://github.com/bol/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles && ./install`
```
